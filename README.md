# OpenGL-Basics
In this repository, I will be adding my code from the courses and experimentation of OpenGL features using Visual Studio.

I will first begin with the course on Computer Graphics with Modern OpenGL and C++.

I will cover various topics including 

1. Creating WIndows and handling inputs
2. Vertex, Fragment and Geoetry shaders
3. Fraw 3D models
4. Use of GLM Library
5. Translate, rotate and Scale models
6. Use of Interpolation
